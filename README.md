sshForShits
===========

Framework for a high interaction SSH honeypot.  The provided "shell" is just a go routine with callbacks which handle command output.


The emulated commands are extremely limited right now, but we welcome more interactive replacements.
Checkout the commands.go file to add or modify some.


A web frontend specifically designed to show shits that got shells can be found at https://github.com/remasis/sshForShitsGooey

A live instance is running at http://shellsforshits.com

Thanks remasis for rolling the GUI, because I have no sense of design...
